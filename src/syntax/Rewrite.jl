    # So the way this is gonna work:
    # prefix an item with ! to indicate it's being removed from I
    # prefix an item with âŠ• to indicate it's being added to R
    # under swapping:
    # - use X => Y to indicate all instances of X in sf are to be swapped with Y in R
    # - use v1 = A + B => C + B to indicate this particular link is being swapped
    # (this makes it easier to swap links)
    # when all links to an object have been removed, it can be inferred that the object itself can be removed, but this isn't currently done.

    # Once we gather all the information:
    # - Create stockflow L from all links attached to parts indicated to be removed and swapped, without them removed
    # - Create stockflow I from all links attached to parts to be removed or swapped, with the removed and swapped parts removed
    # - Create stockflow R from all links attached to parts to be added or swapped to.
    # Define hom(I, L), hom(I, R)
    # Rewrite
